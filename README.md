# Rust-Yew-Cypress example

To-dos:

- [X] Get all this up in GitHub
- [x] Probably split the Rust and Cypress/npm/JS code into separate directories
- [x] Implement Cypress tests
- [ ] Turn this README into something useful
- [ ] Set this up to run in GitHub.io
- [ ] Implement unit tests
  - Not sure if we can do that if my state is stuck inside the component.
    I might need to refactor the state out of the component to be able to
    test that logic in Rust unit tests.
- [ ] Maybe write a blog post and/or video about getting
     Cypress to work with Rust since there doesn't seem
     to be a lot about that out on the Internet.

The initial Rust app is based heavily on
[the video "Building a Rust App with Yew!"](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmOeFrwz8BM>).
