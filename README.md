# Rust-Yew-Cypress example

To-dos:

- [] Get all this up in GitHub
- [] Turn this README into something useful
- [] Probably split the Rust and Cypress/npm/JS code into separate directories
- [] Implement Cypress tests
- [] Implement unit tests
  - Not sure if we can do that if my state is stuck inside the component.
    I might need to refactor the state out of the component to be able to
    test that logic in Rust unit tests.
- [] Maybe write a blog post and/or video about getting
     Cypress to work with Rust since there doesn't seem
     to be a lot about that out on the Internet.
